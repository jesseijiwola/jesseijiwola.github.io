            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, my name is Jesse, and I'm a Computer Science major. I enjoy being active, specifically playing sports such as volleyball where I play on the club team.
                I have interests in cybersecurity which I plan to specialize in after I graduate. Over the summer I worked, spent time with my family, larned to golf, and traveled to Qatar. 
                What qualifies as a bad website is poor accessibility, poor user support, an abundance of pop and ads, not having order to the website and its contents, poor design, and generally things that make the website difficult to use.
                In my opinion I think <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">amazon.com</a> is a bad website. It has an overwhelming layout, the filter option is horrible and sometimes really inaccurate, and the account setting navigation is confusing to new users.!</p>
